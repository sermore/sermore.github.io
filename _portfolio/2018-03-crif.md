[CRIF Credit Management Platform for lenders](https://www.creditsolutions.crif.com/products/platform-for-lenders/)
is a software platform covering the end-to-end credit value chain with built-in best practice for effective credit and risk management.

This project started more than 5 years ago to suit the needs of a specific customer, and after that it has been adapted and transformed in order to be reselled to other customers. Even if it can be seen as a product, it's more like a bare structure which needs to be adapted for each customer. 
In addition, it contains a huge functional complexity that needs to be handled by a business unit with a high level of banking functional knowledge.


**March 2018 - September 2018**
