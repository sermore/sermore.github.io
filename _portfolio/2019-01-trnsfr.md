**Trnsfr** is a simple file sharing tool for self-hosted content.

It's a **Node.js** web application which permits the creation of **public** links with a unique path in the form of `/transfers/unique-id`. Each link permits the download of a zipped content.
The content is defined by a list of glob patterns applied to the server's local file system.
Moreover it is possible to send one or more emails containing the link, with the addition of a subject and a message body.

**Trnsfr** source code is available in the github repository [trnsfr](https://github.com/sermore/trnsfr){:target="_blank"}.

See below some screenshots.
