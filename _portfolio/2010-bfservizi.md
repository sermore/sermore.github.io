  title: BFServizi - Business information system
---

Web based corporate application for BFServizi, part of BolognaFiere group.
The application was meant to manage the whole company's workflow and to be deeply integrated with public e-commerce site.

BFServizi substituited previous, desktop-based business information system with a new web-based system designed from scratch.

First I acted as functional analyst working closely with customer, collecting requirements and interviewing stakeholders. Then I made the software design, and I contributed as lead developer to the application's building.
