This is a small blog about coding written by **Sergio Moretti**.

I'm a full stack software engineer from Bologna, Italy.

I worked mainly in small - medium sized software companies. During my career Iâ€™ve covered almost all positions in the software development process, from software engineer and analyst to project manager and software architect. 
My activities have been primarily focused on the build of non-public web applications based on the customer needs and specifications, using Java on the server side.

I always enjoyed to cultivate my interests in the software development technology, working on side projects and improving my knowledge.
